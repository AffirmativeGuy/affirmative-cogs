# Cog's made in a mysterious way.


# affirmative-cogs

Theese are some of the cogs made by me for my red-discordbot named Cop, this includes commands such as a custom info, custom ping, credits command and etc.

Theese repo is speacilly made for my bot, but if you too want to use it, then you need to fork the repo and edit the content according to your taste.




## Credits

This repo would not be possible without these people's help or contribution:

Twentysix26 - Thanks to 26 for creating red bot.

Vrt-cogs - The command update was inspired from Vrt's pull command.

Yami - Thanks to Yami for helping me with the command re-load thingy part.
